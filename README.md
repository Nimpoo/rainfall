## _RainFall_ is another `ISO challenge`, and the continuation of the project _[SnowCrash](https://github.com/Nimpoo/snow-crash)_ technically, but instead of exploiting and research the vulnerability of a sytem/user, _RainFall_ is specialized in binary exploitation and reasearch of security breaches in binary files.

All the files to exploit are `ELF binary`. The process is always the same : <br />
1. Test the program <br />
2. Decompilation and/or disassembly <br />
3. Analyse the code <br />
4. Exploit the vulnerability

### Basically, **<u>reverse engineering</u>**.

The reconstruction of the code is a big part of each level : knowing the file you have decomplied AND disassembly, use the right tools, have the right interpretation of the code, and **<u>FIND THE BREACH</u>**.

This project introduces the **exploitation of breaches in files**, **memory manipulation**, running **arbritrary code** and the <u>importance of how a program must be protected</u>. All the exploits on these levels are classic, but some are very tricky and can breaks your mind. By far, _RainFall_ is better than _SnowCrash_, but not really funnier to do, you need to learn a lot of things about _How a machhine works_, or even _How the `assembly` works_ :

### **It's a very enriching project**.

_RainFall_ can also be an introduction of the language **ASM** (Assembly) if you never used it before. Sometimes, read the desassembly of a file can be very useful to understand the code and find the breach. After finishing this project and _[OverRide](https://github.com/Nimpoo/override)_, continuing with _[libasm](https://github.com/Nimpoo/libasm)_ is not a bad idea if the language `ASM` is interesting you.

I write this `README.md` after having resolve all the levels with my bro [Noah](https://github.com/noalexan). Even than _SnowCrash_, each level documents the steps I took to solve the challenge, the tools I used, and even the mistakes I made. I aim to transcribe my logic, and my research, and it's more technical than the previous project.

# Virtual Machine Setup

The subject give to us a pdf file with all rules of the project. And an image disk that we have to run with. Personally, I use qemu to run it. But you can use VirtualBox or VMware if you want.

You can view my script to run the virtual machine [here](assets/run.sh).

Just after that, I can connect to my machine with the following command:

```sh
âžœ  ~ ssh level0@127.0.0.1 -p 4242
```

And for get the files from the virtual machine, I use scp:

```sh
âžœ  ~ scp -P 4242 level0@127.0.0.1:/home/user/level0/level0 /Users/mayoub/Desktop
```
